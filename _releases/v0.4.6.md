- [ ] terminal code cleaned up
	- iframe: listeners and triggers are called out
	- module: dead code is cleaned up
- [ ] editor running from iframe
	- patterned after terminal in as much as it makes sense
	- all things work (write tests?)
- [ ] tree running from iframe
	- patterned after terminal in as much as it makes sense
	- all things work (write tests?)
- [ ] basic, two-editor scenario
	- side-by-side
	- command to enter this scenario
	- command to exit this scenario
- [ ] basic two-terminal scenario
	- one on top of the other
	- command to enter this scenario
	- command to exit this scenario

### candidate for do-it-later
- [ ] more complex scenarios
	- dynamic panes through drag and drop
	- all arrangements are saved properly
	- saved to root settings file?
	- this is not as necessary as the items above
	- there is already a great deal of complexity for items above
	- this is potentially much more complex than the items above

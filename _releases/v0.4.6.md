what's left?
- layout module is mostly done
	- just need to start using it
	- some issues left
- think about extensibility
	- plugins
	- store
- move to next version & repeat

How long has it been since 0.4.5?
```

- [ ] new layout / index
	- [X] multiple panes next to each other
	- [X] drag panes to re-order
	- [ ] drag file from tree
	- [ ] index listens for events from each pane
	- [ ] cleaner loader
	- [ ] terminal status bar
	- [ ] tree status bar
	- [X] editor status bar

- [ ] select from command palette broken for tree and editor
- [ ] hotkey does not show project search (but action bar does)

- [ ] basic, two-editor scenario
	- side-by-side
	- command to enter this scenario
	- command to exit this scenario
- [ ] basic two-terminal scenario
	- one on top of the other
	- command to enter this scenario
	- command to exit this scenario

### candidate for do-it-later
- [ ] more complex scenarios
	- dynamic panes through drag and drop
	- all arrangements are saved properly
	- saved to root settings file?
	- this is not as necessary as the items above
	- there is already a great deal of complexity for items above
	- this is potentially much more complex than the items above

- [ ] tree running from iframe
	- [ ] should handle hotkeys (control-p, for example)
	- [ ] patterned after terminal in as much as it makes sense
	- [ ] all things work (write tests?)

- [ ] editor running from iframe
	- [ ] files with same name but different parent should show different tabs
	- [ ] are all triggers needed in editor/events.js?
	- [ ] all things work (write tests?)
		- 
	- [X] should handle hotkeys (control-p, for example)
	- [X] error: fiugd/beta/service-worker/worker.rewrite.js/worker.rewrite.js << not right...
		- this probably has to do with how files are saved to SW state, not sure
		- modules/state.js could not handle name with full path
	- [X] fix a ton of issues related to codemirror handlers
	- [X] patterned after terminal in as much as it makes sense
	- [X] connect to service worker (or overall app)
		- internal messages go to outside
		- external messages come to inside
	- [X] insert editor iframe into app
		- editor build
		- dist in service manifest
	- [X] bring codemirror deps into editor folder
		- as a stop-gap, this is handled by build
		- will cleanup later
	- [X] tiggers have proper namespace
	- [X] reduce the need for:
		- state.js
		- Types.js
		- Listeners.js
	- [X] a single events handling file
	- [X] break editor.js and editorTabs.js up
		- components get modularized and referenced
		- event attachment should congeal from there
	- [X] make editorEvents and editorTabEvents super simple
		- bring listeners into editor.js and editorTabs.js
		- figure out how to cope with this ^^^ later
	- [X] why do editor tabs not work?
	- [X] add status bar to editor

- [X] theme-related css

- [X] move to github.com/fiugd
	- remove references to [crosshj/fiug](https://github.com/fiugd/beta/search?q=crosshj/fiug)
	- bring [bartok](https://github.com/crosshj/bartok)? not now

- [X] [horizontal scroll issues](https://github.com/search?q=horizontal+repo%3Acrosshj%2Ffiug-beta+created%3A2021-10-19&type=Commits&ref=advsearch&l=&l=)

- [ ] uml sequence diagram support
	- syntax and template
	- todo: use frontmatter to define syntax/template
		- plantuml + js-sequence-diagram
		- mermaid
		- nomnoml
		- dotuml, yuml, etc (search vscode extensions for "uml")
	- todo: convert between different syntaxes

- [X] yaml mode improvements

### events & UI
> listen: for events coming from outside
> trigger: to self & outside

1. components
	- render UI
	- expose their handlers
2. event modules declare event connections
3. main component
	- arranges/instantiates rendering
	- connects events with instances

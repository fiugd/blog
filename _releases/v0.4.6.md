- [ ] hotkeys work properly

- [ ] node "process" global & import; does as expected (at least in part)
	- https://nodejs.org/api/process.html
	- 'process' should be available to all scripts as a global
	- 'process' should be available to import, ie. import { argv } from "process"
	- this is import to fiugd/beta/build/build.js for example
	- argv (args to script) <<< important
	- exit
	- write
	- env
	- execArgv (args to node)
	- cwd
	- chdir
	- hrtime

- [ ] terminal code cleaned up
	- iframe: listeners and triggers are called out
	- module: dead code is cleaned up
	- don't git diff large files

- [ ] tree running from iframe
	- patterned after terminal in as much as it makes sense
	- all things work (write tests?)

- [ ] editor running from iframe
	- [ ] error: fiugd/beta/service-worker/worker.rewrite.js/worker.rewrite.js << not right...
		- this probably has to do with how files are saved to SW state, not sure
	- [ ] are all triggers needed in editor/events.js?
	- [ ] all things work (write tests?)
	- [ ] file with same name but differnet parent
		- [X] should show different tabs
		- [ ] should work with tab clicking
	- [X] fix a ton of issues related to codemirror handlers
	- [X] patterned after terminal in as much as it makes sense
	- [X] connect to service worker (or overall app)
		- internal messages go to outside
		- external messages come to inside
	- [X] insert editor iframe into app
		- editor build
		- dist in service manifest
	- [X] bring codemirror deps into editor folder
		- as a stop-gap, this is handled by build
		- will cleanup later
	- [X] tiggers have proper namespace
	- [X] reduce the need for:
		- state.js
		- Types.js
		- Listeners.js
	- [X] a single events handling file
	- [X] break editor.js and editorTabs.js up
		- components get modularized and referenced
		- event attachment should congeal from there
	- [X] make editorEvents and editorTabEvents super simple
		- bring listeners into editor.js and editorTabs.js
		- figure out how to cope with this ^^^ later
	- [X] why do editor tabs not work?
	- [X] add status bar to editor

- [X] theme-related css

- [X] move to github.com/fiugd
	- remove references to [crosshj/fiug](https://github.com/fiugd/beta/search?q=crosshj/fiug)
	- bring [bartok](https://github.com/crosshj/bartok)? (not now)

- [X] [horizontal scroll issues](https://github.com/search?q=horizontal+repo%3Acrosshj%2Ffiug-beta+created%3A2021-10-19&type=Commits&ref=advsearch&l=&l=)


### events & UI
> listen: for events coming from outside
> trigger: to self & outside

1. components
	- render UI
	- expose their handlers
2. event modules declare event connections
3. main component
	- arranges/instantiates rendering
	- connects events with instances

- [ ] terminal code cleaned up
	- iframe: listeners and triggers are called out
	- module: dead code is cleaned up
- [ ] editor running from iframe
	- patterned after terminal in as much as it makes sense
	- all things work (write tests?)
- [ ] tree running from iframe
	- patterned after terminal in as much as it makes sense
	- all things work (write tests?)
- [ ] basic, two-editor scenario
	- side-by-side
	- command to enter this scenario
	- command to exit this scenario
- [ ] basic two-terminal scenario
	- one on top of the other
	- command to enter this scenario
	- command to exit this scenario

- [X] [horizontal scroll issues](https://github.com/search?q=horizontal+repo%3Acrosshj%2Ffiug-beta+created%3A2021-10-19&type=Commits&ref=advsearch&l=&l=)

### WIP


- [ ] connect to service worker (or overall app)
	- [X] internal messages go to outside
	- external messages come to inside
- [ ] insert editor iframe into app
	- [X] editor build
	- [ ] dist in service manifest
- [ ] bring codemirror deps into editor folder

- [X] tiggers have proper namespace
	- some triggers may need to be removed
- [X] reduce the need for:
	- state.js
	- Types.js
	- Listeners.js
- [X] a single events handling file
- [X] break editor.js and editorTabs.js up
	- components get modularized and referenced
	- event attachment should congeal from there
- [X] make editorEvents and editorTabEvents super simple
	- bring listeners into editor.js and editorTabs.js
	- figure out how to cope with this ^^^ later
- [X] why do editor tabs not work?
- [X] add status bar to editor

- [ ] move to github.com/fiugd
	- [ ] remove references to [crosshj](https://github.com/fiugd/beta/search?q=crosshj)


### events & UI
> listen: for events coming from outside
> trigger: to self & outside

1. components
	- render UI
	- expose their handlers
2. event modules declare event connections
3. main component
	- arranges/instantiates rendering
	- connects events with instances

### candidate for do-it-later
- [ ] more complex scenarios
	- dynamic panes through drag and drop
	- all arrangements are saved properly
	- saved to root settings file?
	- this is not as necessary as the items above
	- there is already a great deal of complexity for items above
	- this is potentially much more complex than the items above

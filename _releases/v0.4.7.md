- [ ] themes
	- [theme editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com)
	- [sublime vscode](https://github.com/vbasky/sublime-vscode-plus)
	- [atom one dark textmate](https://github.com/digitalpardoe/One-Dark.tmbundle/tree/master/Themes)
	- [codemirror themes](https://codemirror.net/5/demo/theme.html)

- [ ] open (repo) with fiug.dev
- [ ] paste an image
	- when editor has focus, should do like github does
	- when terminal has focus, ...
	- when tree has focus, ...

- [ ] terminal updates
	- [ ] back/forward arrows
	- [ ] edit item from history and run

- [ ] terminal code cleaned up
	- [ ] iframe: listeners and triggers are called out
	- [ ] module: dead code is cleaned up
	- [ ] don't git diff large files
	- [ ] should handle hotkeys (control-p, for example)
	- [ ] node "process" global & import; does as expected (at least in part)
		- https://nodejs.org/api/process.html
		- 'process' should be available to all scripts as a global
		- 'process' should be available to import, ie. import { argv } from "process"
		- this is import to fiugd/beta/build/build.js for example
		- argv (args to script) <<< important
		- exit
		- write
		- env
		- execArgv (args to node)
		- cwd
		- chdir
		- hrtime

- [ ] more importmap thinking/doing
	- see [deno CDN's](https://deno.land/manual@v1.14.2/npm_nodejs/cdns)
	- see [deno importmaps](https://deno.land/manual@v1.14.2/npm_nodejs/import_maps)

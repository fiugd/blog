arrow keys
	- when entering a command in terminal, arrow through and fix typed input

tab completion
	- when entering a file path
	- when entering a command that is in history
	- when entering arguments to a command, ie. git co{TAB} expands to git config

git alias & related
	- tired of typing out the full url to clone
	- should be able to clone one of my own repos without typing my own name
		- `git clone fiug-beta` versus `git clone crosshj/fiug-beta`
		- depends on user.name being set in git config

automatic git config messages
	- like github & github desktop does when only one file changed
	- based on previous commit messages?

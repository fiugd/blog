- [ ] terminal updates
	- [ ] back/forward arrows
	- [ ] edit item from history and run


- [ ] terminal code cleaned up
	- [ ] iframe: listeners and triggers are called out
	- [ ] module: dead code is cleaned up
	- [ ] don't git diff large files
	- [ ] should handle hotkeys (control-p, for example)
	- [ ] node "process" global & import; does as expected (at least in part)
		- https://nodejs.org/api/process.html
		- 'process' should be available to all scripts as a global
		- 'process' should be available to import, ie. import { argv } from "process"
		- this is import to fiugd/beta/build/build.js for example
		- argv (args to script) <<< important
		- exit
		- write
		- env
		- execArgv (args to node)
		- cwd
		- chdir
		- hrtime

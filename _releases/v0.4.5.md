- [ ] rewrite imports in worker scripts using service worker:
	- [ ] [lexer](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-lexer) (probably won't use this)
	- [ ] [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps)
	- [ ] babel + plugin, see [sw-worker-rewrite incubate](https://github.com/crosshj/fiug-incubator/tree/main/1ncubate/sw-worker-rewrite)

- [ ] preview: file change listeners seem to be broken
	- need details
	- this may be for the `*.*` case(s)
	- see [preview breaking in demo video](https://youtu.be/7T-L-MBFoE4?t=512)

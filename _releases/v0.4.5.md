- [X] preview: file change listeners seem to be broken
	- need details
	- this may be for the `*.*` case(s)
	- see [preview breaking in demo video](https://youtu.be/7T-L-MBFoE4?t=512)
	- not able to reproduce this now, maybe fixed?  I gave up looking
- [X] preview: when current doc matches matcher, show it after preview command exec'ed

- [X] rewrite worker with service worker:
	- option 1: [lexer](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-lexer) (probably won't use this)
	- option 2: babel + plugin, see [sw-worker-rewrite incubate](https://github.com/crosshj/fiug-incubator/tree/main/1ncubate/sw-worker-rewrite)
	- use option 2 in service worker
	- about [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps)
	- console.log gets rewritten as processWrite, messages the parent, ie. terminal
	- rewrite imports to use importmap and / is relative to service
- [X] use rewritten script in node abstraction
	- try not to get stuck in the hole of simulating "execute" in a worker
	- simulating process.exit is a pain
	- just use the old way of doing it from prev node implementation
- [X] test new implementation of node abstraction
	- service worker build script
 	- codemirror update script (actually updates more than codemirror)	 	


### extra
- [X] switch service without requiring refresh
- [X] remove "Open in Preview" from tree context menu (for now)
- [X] root files
	- refactor
	- root settings.json roughly matches vscode
- [X] cleanup old service-worker files
- [X] bug: clicking on doc loads a blank
	- see [this happening in demo](https://youtu.be/jPt3nVPCiZ4?t=384)
- [X] terminal loading spinner
	- see [spinner incubate](https://github.com/crosshj/fiug-incubator/tree/main/1ncubate/terminal-spinner)
	- commit
	- clone

	- http://jsfiddle.net/sindresorhus/2eLtsbey/embedded/result/
	- https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners/blob/HEAD/spinners.json
- [X] issue with git config not updating editor state (and currently opened .git/config, etc)
- [X] shortened git commit urls (added color)
- [X] made an intro for release videos

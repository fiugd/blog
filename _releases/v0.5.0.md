- [ ] on editor scroll, show minimap viewport indicator overlay, disappear when scroll is done
- [ ] preview: when current doc matches matcher, show it after preview command exec'ed

- [ ] rewrite imports in worker scripts using service worker:
	- [ ] [lexer](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-lexer)
	- [ ] [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps)
	- [ ] babel + plugin

- [ ] focus on / zoom to a folder (in explorer)
- [ ] search has performance issues
- [ ] uploading images + binary files
- [X] click to select file from command palette opener

- [ ] terminal should get cwd and service name from query params
- [ ] terminal left/right arrows for editing buffer

- [ ] editor tabs order of next tab closing should make sense
- [ ] explorer: add expand|collapse
- [ ] explorer: overscroll seems to not be working
- [ ] explorer: scroll bar hide/show causes status circle to dance (on Mac)
- [ ] explorer > right-click > Open In Preview
	- should work with new terminal preview command

- [ ] context menu for terminal
- [ ] terminal passes hotkey events to parent
	- control-s: save
	- control-p: open file
	- control-shift-p: command window

- [ ] reveal in sidebar is broken
- [ ] editor tabs: keep open, pin, reveal in sidebar

- [ ] clean up for editor document state
- [ ] make sure editor undo history works properly

- [ ] terminal tab completion

- [ ] service worker should provide endpoint for directory contents list
- [ ] path resolution needs to be a module or endpoint; this needs to be a solved issue


- [ ] git clone + git pull + status + push (in terminal)
- [ ] git pull should bring in new changes (okay to reject if changes exist on local)
- [ ] on repo "clone", don't pull all files
	- instead get from github as needed (except for templates)

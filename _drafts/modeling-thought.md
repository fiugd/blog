"All models are wrong, some models are useful" -- E.P. Box


Most of this document can be considered me obsessing over geometric models I have seen for defining and augmenting thought.  I will try to collect as much of that thought as I can here, but I will also try to take it to a place where it can be connected with "smart" tools like modeling and simulation.


I want to talk about using geometic models as thought aids.  I'll start with a well know example and pose questions after and along the way.

Example: Political Identity Modelling

### 1D Model
  <svg viewBox="0 0 100 20">
    <g>
      <line x1=4 x2=96 y1=10 y2=10 />
      <text x=0 y=80% text-anchor="start">left</text>
      <text x=100 y=80% text-anchor="end">right</text>
    </g>
  </svg>


### 2D Model
  <svg
    viewBox="0 0 100 100"

    <g class="layer">
      <title>Layer 1</title>
      <line x1=50 x2=50 y1=10 y2=90 />
      <line x1=10 x2=90 y1=50 y2=50 />
      <text x=50 y=4 text-anchor="middle">authoritarian</text>
      <text x=50 y=98 text-anchor="middle">libetarian</text>
      <text x=4 y=50 class="vertical">left</text>
      <text x=96 y=50 class="vertical">right</text>
    </g>

Thoughts
--------

The addition of an extra dimension makes it possible to make a finer point about political identity.  Something is gained; probably more than what is mentioned here.

Some clarity and simplicity is lost in adding this dimension.  Something is lost; probably more than what is mentioned.

- Can we go higher in dimension to gain (and possibly lose) more?

- Can we make it easier to visualize and play with this?
    - it should be as easy as typing or sketching to create the visual
    - should be able to connect model into a modelling and simulation environment (and define that environment)
    - should be easy to increase dimensionality and reason about higher dimensions where visual model may fail

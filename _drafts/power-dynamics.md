# Situation 1:
- Party A has an ubundant supply resource A.
- Party A would benefit greatly from some Taboo Action A.
- Party A would suffer repercussions if they were responsible for that action.
- Party B needs or strongly feels the imperative to acquire resource A.
- Party A would share resource A with party B.
- Party B commits Taboo Action A, Party A benefits and Party B potentially benefits.

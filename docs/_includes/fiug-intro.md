Hello, I am Harrison, the first creator of fiug.

## what is fiug?

fiug is a browser-based development environment which offers alternative workflows for popular languages and frameworks.

Think of it as an online, code playground that grew up and became the way you build, explore, and maintain your creations.


## yet another browser IDE?

There are already well-established tools for working with languages and frameworks.  Why not just use those?

The answers to those questions are reasonably simple.  Before the answers, though, let's sidetrack.

Now, here's the simple answer: fiug is an attempt to make it better.

There are other tools that do something similar, but I found them lacking and began working on an alternative.

About the browser:  this is the fastest and most ubiquitous way to achieve the goal stated above.  For now, fiug is hosted here.  Maybe some day it will find other homes.


## ...and then?

I'll leave it there for now.  I'm happy to discuss further (I do value discussion), but really I'd prefer to build with you.

Find me in either case.

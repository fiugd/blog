## what is fiug?

fiug is a development environment for the browser which offers alternative workflows for popular languages and frameworks.

Think of it as an online, code playground that grew up and became the way you build, explore, and maintain your creations.

You can try it out for yourself at [fiug.dev](https://fiug.dev).

You can explore the current, WIP version of fiug at [beta.fiug.dev](https://beta.fiug.dev).

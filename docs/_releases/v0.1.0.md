started: 2020-03-20
release: 2020-03-24

Summary
=======
  - now UI looks vaguely like VS Code or Atom
  - [Release Video](https://youtu.be/nFXOxs-oDMA)

Current State
=============
##### paneView
  - still buggy",
  - explorer
  - editor
  - terminal

##### explorer
  - mocked for now
  - UI services not a primary concern

##### editor
  - tabs are mocked
  - same as before

##### terminal
  - not as easy it I would think
  - full parity is not a priority
  - let's me rapidly develop with few UI changes

##### server
  - not much changed
  - change of heart with pm2 - will probably switch to it
  - kubernetes inspiration
  - persist versus update

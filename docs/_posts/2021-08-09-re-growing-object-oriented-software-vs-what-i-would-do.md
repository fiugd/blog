I thought also thought I would send this in an email, but I'm working on my blog chops and this is a subject I'll come back to.

I feel compelled at first to thank you for a good read.  Thanks!  Also, I appreciate that you seem to be on a similar journey as myself and I applaud your method of discovery.

One thing that strikes me about all of this OOP-functional-imperative-etc is that our language designers and other assorted heroes purport to have figured out something they probably have no right to.  

How is it that someone who is entrenched in language design has also figured out how all code should be organized and created?  

How is it that someone who spends all of their time blogging and conferencing has also figured this out?  

How did they figure all of this out so early in coding history?

Let's imagine that these gods have actually figured it out, though.  

Where is the proof?  

From where I sit, all the code I've ever seen looks like a mess that takes time to figure out.  Maybe the best I have seen is when a package or service hides the mess away.  This doesn't prove anything, IMO.

I'm trying to stay on topic, but much of the same sentiment can be applied to types, testing, and perhaps a few other dev flame wars.

I'll leave it there.

Hopefully, you take this as applause, albeit  from some random person with no credentials to speak of.  

Harrison Cross appreciates what you wrote.  Thanks.

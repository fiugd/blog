### Difficult People (DP)

"an unexamined life is not worth living"
\- Socrates also see “When Nietzsche Wept” by Irvin Yalom

> Some people are difficult.
> Some people are harsh.
> Given results DP achieve, must be some value to being a DP.
> Perhaps, being DP is about being genuine at the cost of politeness.

_a running list of all the explorations I would like to dig deeper into_

### Simulations
- N-copter
	- quad copter
	- copter with any given number of rotors
	- real physics for rotors
- biped - n-ped
	- biped locomotion
	- n-legged locomotion
- wheeled vehicles kenematics
	- [pros-and-cons-for-different-types-of-drive-selection](https://robohub.org/pros-and-cons-for-different-types-of-drive-selection/)
	- differential drive robot
	- ackerman steering (car)
	- holonomic robot
	- ball robot
	- treaded


### Machine Learning
- when should bank account be checked? (predict likliehood of change)

### Markov Chains
- https://github.com/Edwin-Pratt/js-markov

### Reinforcement Learning
- wtf happened in my college class on this?


### Control Theory
- PID tuning
- wtf happened in my college class on this?


### Signal Processing
- Kalman filter
	- [kalmanjs](https://github.com/wouterbulten/kalmanjs)
	- [Kalman.js](https://github.com/infusion/Kalman.js/)
- sensor fusion
	- [wtf is sensor fusion](https://towardsdatascience.com/wtf-is-sensor-fusion-part-2-the-good-old-kalman-filter-3642f321440)


### Image Processing | Manipulation | Creation
- object detection
- background removal
- chop and remix and shuffle an image
- basic operations I want to do all the time
	- crop
	- paste and add text or speech bubble
	- graph of nodes with connections
	- slideshows
	- scan multiple pages into a pdf document
- procedural art


### Game Helpers
- Line Rangers
	- whats the best ranger to upgrade?
	- how often do certain rewards drop?
	- is it worth it to purchase something?
	- what is the best gear to place on ranger?


### Math (see mathematics.js)
- convolution - [intuitive convolution](https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-convolution/)
- z-transform
- eigenvalues
- fourier transform


### Knowledge Graph
- all the notes/threads/connections in one place
	- google bookmarks
	- pocket (Read It Later)
	- old bookmarks from Firefox, Chrome, delicious
	- notes from email
	- Amazon Wishlist
	- goodreads
	- youtube likes / watch later
	- old notes in text files (or elsewhere?)
- can be visualized
- can be searched easily
- can be globbed together, tagged, sorted
- can be shared
- will remind me to come back to it
- also see: [HN comments thread about Dendron,a ROAM alternative](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23890035)


### Code, Languages, Computing
- *use case: create a dependency graph (visualize code connections)*
- *use case: change the location of required/imported dependencies*
- *use case: transform code from one format to another*
- abstract syntax tree
	- [Manipulating AST with javascript](https://lihautan.com/manipulating-ast-with-javascript/)
	- [AST Explorer](https://github.com/fkling/astexplorer/blob/master/README.md)
	- [babel AST Explorer](https://lihautan.com/babel-ast-explorer/)
- parser generator
	- [ohm editor](https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/)
- user interface markup language
	- I would like to start UI's with this but not go as low level with it as some I have seen
	- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_markup_language)


### Zietgeist Engine
- think Mechanical Turk, then stop
- think facebook analytics or google analytics or search engines or social media, then stop
- We have not completely figured out how the individual can query the mass brain (or even smaller collectives)
- I have a picture some place of this... had a long talk with Mehul about it... maybe lost

### Systems Architecture
- this is LESS about classic architecture patterns and thinking
- this is LESS about making manually making graphs, pictures, and annotations
- this is MORE about implementing running models of a few system patterns I am interested in
	- kubernetes
	- [simple storm](https://github.com/ajlopez/SimpleStorm)
		- [a talk about the original](https://vimeo.com/40972420) 	
	- [expression engine](https://github.com/crosshj/experiments/tree/gh-pages/svg/engine-src)
	- the bartok system (mainly backend portion)
- I wonder how much distributed systems functionality can/should be implemented in a programming language
	- can internal system messages be interchanged with external calls?
	- how can components of a distributed system be seen as parts of one system (is this a naive question?) 	
- the intent is not to fully implement the system components more than needed to explore the pattern
- [Analysis of Message-Passing Concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqZ0uO7g4RQ)
- can shader languages and programming for GPU's inform this discussion?
	- [Parallel, distributed and GPU computing technologies...](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2703572/)

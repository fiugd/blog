- Doing things in a non-standard way means:
	- you may have a hard time getting help
	- people may not understand what you have done
	- you may not get done in time
	- you may deal with problems that nobody else has
	- people may not be able to relate to what you are doing
	- you may learn a lot
	- you may create something that nobody else has
- Thursdays suck

### 2020-10-23 - things I have known myself to be sick of

- hearing people gripe or argue about the behavior of huge corporations instead of spending resources on smaller projects/vendors/companies who are better positioned to behave properly
	( it's much more fun to think we have a say in big brother's doings versus support little brother's half-baked WIP )

- the behavior of big corporations / organizations / systems
	- omg my Nexus 6P has been a nightmare and it seems I haven't had a reliable phone in a while if not ever
	- the Pixel 4 XL update to Android 11 causes multiple apps to crash and it seems the maker of the phone doesn't really care
	- immigration process and all it's paperwork suck
	- any time I intend to do something significant in my life, there is always some todo list of drudgery associated; I struggle to see how it benfits anyone
		- enroll kids in school
		- make a visit to the doctor or dentist
		- file taxes
	- operating systems suck
	- enterprise code sucks
	- cars suck
	- computers suck
	- government sucks

- weekends being so short sucks

- Monday's suck

- working for "the man" sucks

- people suck

- speaking/writing sucks

- listening sucks


- discussions about all of these suck after about 1-2 hours of debating them
	- religion
	- philosophy
	- government
	- theoretical physics
	- gender issues

### Closed Mind, The Game: Software Dev Edition

```Let's play the game and never think about the game. OMG Cancer!``` - John Wayne
```Let's think about the game and never play the game. WTF Hemlock!``` - Socrates

##### PREMISE:
soul of the mind: _topics | policies | discussions | theory | debates | decisions_
body of the mind: _groups and individuals that make up the group_
when is it safe/best to have a closed vs open mind?

##### RULES:
1) there is a button with words written on it: _*JUST LET ME DO MY DAMNED JOB!*_
2) at any point this button can be pressed by any player to exit a topic
3) topic switches when an X number of players have hit the button
4) during the course of the game, players take turns discussing concepts such as those below
5) the game proceeds until only X players are left standing and/or all topics are exhausted

##### TOPICS:
- testing, test patterns, test practices, test coverage, unit vs integration tests, etc
- how to [if or else and or maybe but switch except when](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2021/03/06/ifElseSwitch.html)
- OOP, functional, procedural
- type systems (and personal/group preference for types)
- code readbility, style, and maintenance (and how to do it)
- process and workflow (how to track and manage changes in a system and people doing those changes)
- add your own topics!

##### ROLES:
- certain players can veto discussion (and end the game) or force a topic open:
	- product manager, product owner, customer
	- dev lead
	- architect
	- manager
- other players can assume these roles which sometimes have the same effect:
	- comedian
	- pervert
	- criminal
	- magician
	- lunch or GTFH

##### WINNING/LOSING:
- once the game is over, all players evaluate the results and learn something, we hope
- we may have some ideas for solutions to some problems at this point
- you will definitely have some answers (right?); did someone take notes?

##### BONUS ROUND:
can anyone tell us who won?

## Some Thoughts
- Q: why v0.31 instead of v0.4?
- A: had v0.4 planned and didn't feel like doing what was planned

- Q: will I ever focus more on server?
- A: there are (too many) features, like templates, that make sense to figure out on UI first

## Current State

### meta
- [X] redo context menus
- [X] scrollbars look better (finally)
- [X] file templates can be written from UI

### bugs
- [X] editor does not change when loading new service
- [X] when switching between two previewable document tabs, preview does not change
- [X] weird bug when saving
	- sometimes a file does not get saved as itself and is instead saved as default file
- [X] deleting a file acts weird and sometimes doesn't work

### explorer
- [X] better context menus
- [X] some file operations available via context menus

### terminal (should call this something else now?)
- [X] preview for html, jsx, svg (kinda hard-coded)
- [X] markdown preview (templates!)

### serviceMap
- [X] actual system services in Service Map
- [X] service map switch back and forth between UI service and system services

How are these bound together?

How are these combined with each other?



## Model:

a store usually handles model storage an manipulation
but often application and external logic show up in a store

also a store/framework handles how models are bound together

flux/redux wants to abandon the model in favor of composing actions?



## View

this should be updated from the store and present a visual/html/css
but often "extras" show up, see containers & lifecycle methods

also views handle how store/models are bound to some degree
also views handle things like making network calls and routing state



## Controller

this should handle user input and change state/model
flux/redux stores typically do this, but react views can do the same

should controllers make network requests?
how should controllers be composed?

react does diffs before View versus others that diff after model
